This is a personal website that showcases my skills, projects, and experiences as a front-end developer. The website includes a home page with an introduction about me, a portfolio section highlighting my projects with descriptions, a resume section with my work experience and education, and a contact form for potential employers or collaborators to reach out to me. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Bootstrap for styling and responsiveness. It is a showcase of my abilities and a central hub for anyone interested in my work to learn more about me and my projects.
